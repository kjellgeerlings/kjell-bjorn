        <p>According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
<s>there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.</s>

 <br> 
Its wings are too small to get
            <u>its fat little body off the ground.</u>

  
<b>>The bee, of course, flies anyway</b>

  
            <i>because</i>
<q>bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.</q></p>
